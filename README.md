# VTU Student Hub

A Student Platform for VTU Resources, Problem Solvers, CGPA &amp; SGPA Calculators.

Designed As a side project for us to make use of the rather questionable Python Math Lab Programs, which were recently made part of the 2022 scheme of VTU.

This will also help juniors moving forward because when we were in the semester we made these calculators, we couldn't find any resources to find answers to some questions given in textbooks/classes. So, we created this website to serve as a resource for juniors to find answers quickly to verify.

For educational purposes only, we DO NOT CONDONE cheating using our website.
